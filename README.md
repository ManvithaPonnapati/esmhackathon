## Introduction

Ectopic expression of proteins can endow cells with new capabilities, such as rendering neurons photosensitive by expressing opsins, which allows for optical control in techniques like optogenetics [1]. Optogenetics, along with related methods such as chemogenetics and sonogenetics, has revolutionized neuroscience and holds great potential for neuromodulatory therapies targeting neurological disorders [2]. The ability to selectively express opsins in specific neuronal cell types can enable precise and efficient optogenetic manipulation.

Current methods introduce ectopic proteins by packaging the gene, along with a promoter, into a viral capsid (e.g., AAV6-hSyn-Chrimson) and delivering it into nervous tissue or the bloodstream. Selective expression of opsins can be achieved by utilizing cell-type specific promoters. However, only a few cell-type specific promoters are small enough to be packaged with AAV [3], and some cell types do not have well-characterized promoter sequences [3].

One key mechanism of gene expression is the activation of promoter sequences by transcription factors. We hypothesize that engineering new transcription factors and smaller promoter sequences activated by those transcription factors could significantly enhance our ability to selectively control cell-type specific expression in neuronal cells.

## Datasets

We focused on mice neuronal cells during the hackathon. To enable generation of cell-type specific promoter sequence and transcription factors we wanted to collect following data. 

1. List of all neuronal cell types
2. Differential expression of genes in all the cell types along with DNA sequence and promoter sequences. Other regulatory DNA sequences. 
3. Transcription factors in mice and their corresponding protein sequences
4. Transcription factors that are known to effect gene expression in neuronal cell types in mice

Obtaining data is required gathering datasets from various studies and databases, and linking them together. We hope this dataset is valuable beyond this hackathon.
